# Cloud Computing
- __on-demand delivery__ of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
- __pay-as-you-go pricing__
- __provision exactly the right type and size of computing__
- access as many resources __almost instantly__
- simple way to access __servers, storage, databases__ and a set of application services

## The Deployment Models of the Cloud
- Private Cloud
- Public Cloud
- Hybrid Cloud

## The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing
- On-demand self service
- Broad network access
- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
- Rapid elasticity and scalability
- Measured service

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
- Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
- Stop guessing capacity
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes

## Problems solved by the Cloud
- Flexibility
- Cost-Effectiveness
- Scalability
- Elasticity
- High-availability and fault-tolerance
- Agility

## Types of Cloud Computing
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Amazon EC2 (on AWS)
GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS)
Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning)
Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom

## Pricing of the Cloud
- Compute
- Storage
- Data transfer OUT of the Cloud

## AWS Global Infrastructure
- AWS Regions
all around the world (us-east-1)
cluster of data centers
__Most AWS services are region-scoped__
