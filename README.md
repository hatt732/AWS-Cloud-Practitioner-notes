# Notes for AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

# Contents

# Cloud Computing
- __on-demand delivery__ of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
- __pay-as-you-go pricing__
- __provision exactly the right type and size of computing__
- access as many resources __almost instantly__
- simple way to access __servers, storage, databases__ and a set of application services

## The Deployment Models of the Cloud
- Private Cloud
- Public Cloud
- Hybrid Cloud

## The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing
- On-demand self service
- Broad network access
- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
- Rapid elasticity and scalability
- Measured service

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
- Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
- Stop guessing capacity
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes

## Problems solved by the Cloud
- Flexibility
- Cost-Effectiveness
- Scalability
- Elasticity
- High-availability and fault-tolerance
- Agility

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - Amazon EC2 (on AWS)
  - GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS)
  - Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning)
  - Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom


## Pricing of the Cloud
- Compute
- Storage
- Data transfer OUT of the Cloud

## AWS Global Infrastructure

- AWS Regions
  - all around the world (us-east-1)
  - cluster of data centers
  - __Most AWS services are region-scoped__
- AWS Availability Zones
  - many availability zones (usually 3, min is 2, max is 6) ap-southeast-2a
  - isolated from disasters
  - connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
- AWS Data Centers
- AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence
  - Content is delivered to end users with lower latency

## AWS Services Scope
- Global Services
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  - Route 53 (DNS service)
  - CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
  - WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- Region Services - Most AWS services

## Shared Responsibility Model
- CUSTOMER = Responsibility for the security __IN__ the cloud
- AWS = Responsibility for the security __OF__ the cloud

## AWS Acceptable Use Policy
- No Illegal, Harmful, or Offensive Use or Content
- No Security Violations
- No Network Abuse
- No E-Mail or Other Message Abuse
